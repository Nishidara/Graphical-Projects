# Graphical-Projects
All my graphical projects done at Epitech.

RPG- This project is one of the freest project of our first year. Create our own RPG.
Our main challenge for this game was to create a complete product using everything that our
team know.
To give the users the feeling that we’re delivering a complete product we needed to polish as much as possible
our game.
Our game had to follow the following rules:
• Having a pleasant user interface.
• Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, . . . )
• Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.
And some more mandatory tasks.

MyHunter - In this project, we are asked to make a small video game based on the rules of Duck Hunt.
The basic rules for the my_hunter are as follows:
• the player is a hunter who shoots ducks.
• ducks must appear on the screen and move from one side to another.
• the player can click on them to shoot them.
And some more mandatory tasks.
